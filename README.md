The final aim is to enable the possibility of creating a unique chart for different wallet across different EVM-compatible blockchains. <br /><br />
Currently, you can find the scripts to load a chart of your wallet for some EVM-compatible blockchains like Ethereum, BSC, Moonriver, Polygon and Arbitrum. <br />
The chart is generated based on the assets in the wallet at the moment the program is executed. The chart shows the value of the wallet in the last 30 days.
